# hamenv
Infrastructure deployment for ham radio tools.

## What is this?
This is just a small project that intends on simplifying the 
build and deployment process for a lot of popular ham radio 
solutions.  Generally use of this repository would be from an 
advanced user that wishes to build their own artifacts of the 
provided solutions and implement within thier own infrastructures.

While over time it may include deployment schemes which cover a 
broader scope of possibilities, but initially the cloud resource 
provider will be focused on AWS.  However, the Terraform/Ansible 
that is leveraged will try to maintain a heirarchy that allows 
to easily implement any additional providers.


## Proposals
There are a lot of nifty solutions for dealing with ham 
radio that may make sense to have running on a machine that 
is not directly connected to equipment.

Please open an issue with the `enhancement` label to request 
for a solution you like to be containerized and in the event 
that it makes sense, it will be added into the backlog for 
completion.
